                <p>playgrounds offer a multitude of benefits that go far beyond aesthetics and giving kids something fun to do. They are the heart of a community and an indispensable gathering space that can benefit everyone. Community playgrounds provide children the opportunity to practice and hone key skills including social, emotional, cognitive and physical. Children are constantly learning through play—making new friends, sharing, taking turns and interacting with other children. This increased interaction with children of all backgrounds and abilities gives kids a more open view of the world and the opportunity to build new relationships.</p>
